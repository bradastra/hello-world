# Hello World Repository

Welcome to my `hello-world` repository!

This repository is a showcase of my early Python projects and experiments.

- `hello.py`: A simple program that outputs "Hello, World!"
- `weather.py`: A basic weather-related script.
- `even_odd_game.py`: A fun game where you guess if a randomly generated number is even or odd.

Feel free to explore and provide any feedback. Thank you for stopping by!
